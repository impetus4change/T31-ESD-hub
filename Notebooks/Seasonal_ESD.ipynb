    "This notebook is prepared to provide you a guideline to recap the ESD analysis conducted for the seasonal climate predictions in the scope of I4C project. It is a platform that makes the users enable to reproduce the data generated in the project. It offers **transparent access to a wide range of information and data**, thereby promoting robust scientific investigations and supporting climate change assessment efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guideline is divided into several sections. We will begin by outlining the overarching aim and motivation behind the IPCC-Hub, clarifying its purpose and significance in the realm of climate research. Subsequently, we delve into the Description of the available material within the IPCC-Hub, providing insights into the diverse datasets and resources at your disposal for climate analysis. Finally, in the section on Data loading and basic data operations, **we walk you through the fundamental steps required to start working with climate data effectively**.\n"

    "1. **var**: Which variable to be downscaled. Available variables:\n",
    "   * hurs: Relative humidity\n",
    "   * prlr: Precipitation\n",
    "   * sfcWind: Surface wind\n",
    "   * tas: Temperature\n",
    "   * tasmax: Maximum temperature\n",
    "   * tasmin: Minimum temperature\n",
    "2. **dwn_type**: Which downscaling methods to be applied. Available methods:\n",
    "   * analogs: Analogs method\n",
    "   * intbc: Interpolation + bias correction\n",
    "   * intlr: Interpolation + linear regression\n",
    "   * logreg: Logistic regression\n",
    "3. **freq**: Temporal resolution of the data to be downscaled. Available options are \"daily_data\" or \"monthly_day\". Usage of the daily_data is only recommended for the analogs. Other than this method, the improvement does not exist or marginal, despite adding a huge amount of computational load.\n",
    "4. **int_method**: Interpolation method to be used to disaggregate the coarse scale model data to the high observation resolution. Only required when dwn_type is **'intbc'**, **'intlr'** or **'logreg'**. Otherwise, it should be set to **NULL**. Available methods:\n",
    "   * bic: Bicubic interpolation\n",
    "   * bil: Bilinear interpolation\n",
    "   * con: Conservative interpolation\n",
    "   * con2: Second-order conservative interpolation\n",
    "   * dis: Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation\n",
    "   * laf: Largest area fraction interpolation\n",
    "   * nn: Nearest neighbour interpolation\n",
    "5. **bc_method**: Bias adjustment or calibration method to be applied on the disaggregated data through the int_method. Only required when dwn_type is **'intbc'**. Otherwise, it should be set to **NULL**. Available methods:\n",
    "   * bias: Simple bias adjustment\n",
    "   * crps_min: Minimization of continuous ranked probability score (CPRS)\n",
    "   * evmos: Variance inflation method\n",
    "   * mse_min: Minimization of mean squared error (MSE)\n",
    "   * qm: Quantile mapping method\n",
    "   * rpc-based: Maximization of ratio of predictable components (RPC)\n",
    "6. **lr_method**: Linear regression method. Only required when dwn_type is **'intlr'**. Otherwise, it should be set to **NULL**. Available methods:\n",
    "   * basic: Basic linear regression. This method is applied on the disaggregated data through the int_method.\n",
    "   * 4nn: Four nearest neighbours. 4nn skips the interpolation step since the method itself inherently downscale the coarse resolution data to the reference data resolution without the need for interpolation.\n",
    "7. **log_reg_method**: Logistic regression method to be utilized on the disaggregated data through the int_method. Only required when dwn_type is **'logreg'**. Otherwise, it should be set to **NULL**. Available methods:\n",
    "   * ens_mean: Usage of the ensemble mean for each time step as the predictor\n",
    "   * ens_mean_sd: Usage of the mean and standard deviation of the ensemble for each time step as the predictor\n",
    "   * sorted_members: Usage of the ensemble member values as the predictor after sorted them in decreasing order for each time step\n",
    "8. **nanalogs**: An integer indicating the number of analogs to be searched. Only required when dwn_type is **'analogs'**. Otherwise, it should be set to **NULL**.\n",
    "9. **target_month**: An integer representing the month to be downscaled (ranging from 1 to 12).\n",
    "10. **lt**: Lead time ranging from 0 to 3. For example, if the target month is 2 and the lead time is 0, predictions for February obtained from the GCM initiated in February will be downscaled. If the target month is 2 and the lead time is 1, predictions for February obtained from the GCM initiated in January will be downscaled, and so on.\n",
    "11. **demon**: The demonstrator (i.e., region), over where the downscaling will be carried out. Available options:\n",

    "    * Catalonia\n",
    "    * Paris\n",
